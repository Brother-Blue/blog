## My Background

I started off my professional life studying software engineering and management—covering every aspect of the software development lifecycle, right up to the big question: "What happens once you release your app?" To answer that, I jumped into DevOps, which quickly got rebranded (and rebranded again): DevSecOps, then DevSecFinOps, and with the rise of AI/ML, DevSecFinAI/MLOps. Eventually, someone just called it "Platform." Semantics aside, it was one of the most valuable experiences I could have had straight out of university.

Getting to see the full picture—from planning and building applications, to automating testing, deployments, and monitoring, to securely configuring and maintaining the environments those apps run on—felt like reaching the top of the curve. One struggle I’ve faced (and see almost daily) is `Tutorial Hell`. I won’t get into what it is or why it’s bad; there are plenty of Medium articles and Reddit threads for that. What I want to do here is provide complete, start-to-finish tutorials for anyone else looking to reach that peak.

## Why Brother Blue?

`Brother Blue` was a nickname my brother gave me over a decade ago, and it’s stuck, kind of a second identity at this point. Honestly, it’s also practical. If you’ve ever tried to get a “professional” domain with the name Chris, good luck. Last I checked, there are about 400,000 of us in the US alone, not counting all the variations.
